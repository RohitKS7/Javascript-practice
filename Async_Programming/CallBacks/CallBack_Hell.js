/* "Callback hell" refers to a situation in JavaScript where you have multiple nested callbacks, making the code difficult to read, maintain, and debug. 
This often occurs when dealing with asynchronous operations that depend on each other. The code can become deeply nested, resembling a pyramid shape, which is why itâ€™s sometimes called "pyramid of doom." */
